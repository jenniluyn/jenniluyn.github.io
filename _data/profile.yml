    Hey, my name is Jenni. I am a second year PhD student in Cell and Developmental Biology at The University of British Columbia
    in Vancouver, Canada. I am a member of the <a href="https://pouladilab.org/" target="_blank">Pouladi Lab,</a> where I study genetic
    modifiers of Huntington disease in mouse models.
  </p>
    <p>
    I am interested in medical writing as a career. I write for The Ubyssey and I also publish things on my personal Substack from time
    to time. I enjoy movies, music, being outside, and reading/writing.
  </p>
