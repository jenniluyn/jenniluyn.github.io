    Hey, my name is Jenni. I am a second year PhD student in Cell and Developmental Biology at The University of British Columbia
    in Vancouver, Canada. I am a member of the <a href="https://pouladilab.org/" target="_blank">Pouladi Lab,</a> where I study genetic
    modifiers of Huntington disease in mouse models. After graduating from Wellesley College in 2021, I worked at several biotech startups in 
    Massachusetts, where I gained experience in drug discovery and the pharmaceutical industry.
  </p>
    <p>
    I have career interests in medical writing. I write for The Ubyssey, and publish things on my personal Substack from time
    to time. I enjoy reading/writing, movies, music, and being outside whenever I can.
  </p>
